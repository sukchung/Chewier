## Overview

A pet food e-commerce site that includes the option to create your own customized pet food formula.

## DESIGN

[API Design](docs/api-design.md)

[GHI](docs/wireframes.md)

## Target Audience

Our target audience is pet owners who are looking for a customizable shopping experience.

## MVP and Functionality

Users can create an account and log into that account. While logged in, they can create and add a pet profile to their account, and they can also complete a form that creates a customized pet food formula and adds it to their cart. Logged in and non-logged in users can browse the site inventory by viewing the entire inventory or applying a filter option that displays a targeted inventory. Additionally, users can utilize a search bar to search for specific items in the inventory and checkout their shopping cart.
