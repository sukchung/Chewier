Today, I worked on:

- I tried working on fixing the CORS issue that
  occurred after I deployed on CapRover. I need to
  look into this error and pinpoint the error.
  Endpoints are working correctly.
- I also completed my unit test for one of the
  inventory endpoints, so I am happy about that.
  Now, I have to finish working on deployment.

## Jan. 23, 2022

Today, I worked on:

- I continued working on deployment. It took a
  long time to figure out why PostgreSQL did not
  want to deploy on CapRover. Andrew was able to
  help me out with this issue. I also finished
  the logout feature.
- I was later able to deploy both microservices
  and see the deployed website for the first time.

Today, I worked on:

- Today, I finished the products page, and I
  started working on deployment today. I watched
  Andrew's recording on deployment, and I also
  asked for help. James, Robbie, and Rosheen
  were able to help me successfully deploy one of
  my microservices.
- I am also going to work on the logout feature
  that will log out the user and hide the sign up
  and log in links when logged in.

Today, I worked on:

- Today, I am still working on the products page,
  and I am also working on the UI styling of the
  list page. The products page is able to
  re-render when a product is added to the
  inventory.
- I am going to review CI/CD to get more familiar
  with it as well as unit tests.

## Jan. 18, 2022

Today, I worked on:

- I worked on the products page for the front
  end and also work on the UI styling of it. I am
  trying to make the shopping cart button appear
  when hovering over the product image.
  Hopefully, it turns out the way I want it to.
- I am excited about using Bootstrap and CSS to style
  it.

## Jan. 17, 2022

Today, I worked on:

- I completed my sign up page, and Alex, Lauren,
  and I are working on our components for the
  products page where the products can be
  displayed after fetching.
- I am currently looking up ways to have my
  products show up in the list page.

## Jan. 13, 2022

Today, I worked on:

- We finally finished our backend and merged our
  branches to main. We also delegated our front
  end components. We used this "Wheel of Names"
  website to decide who would get what component
  for the front end. I ended up with creating the
  sign up page.
- I am looking up ways to sign up. I could have
  the user automatically log in after signing up,
  or I could have the user be redirected to the
  log in page after signing up.

## Jan. 12, 2022

Today, I worked on:

- Alex, Lauren, and I successfully finished our
  portion for the inventory microservice. We have
  our API endpoints working and ready to go!
- Now, we have to work on authentication. Carter,
  Matt, and Robbie have been helping with our
  authentication issues.

## Jan. 11, 2022

Today, I worked on:

- We are still working on our inventory
  microservice. Hutch, Lauren, and I are
  troubleshooting bugs on why the routers are not
  showing up on FastAPI.
- We are watching Curtis' videos on Learn, and
  they are super helpful! I am able to make
  FastAPI endpoints through these videos.

## Jan. 10, 2022

Today, I worked on:

- Hutch, Lauren, and I are using Live Share to
  pair program. We are creating our API
  endpoints and setting up routers and queries.
- We also learned how to use and read pgAdmin.
  Andrew showed us how to create a database and
  view our data.

## Jan. 9, 2022

Today, I worked on:

- Today is the day, we start coding! Over the
  weekend, we read and reviewed the FastAPI
  material. I also created some mock code for the
  inventory backend.
- Hutch, Lauren, and I used Live Share for the
  first time. It is sort of like Google Docs and
  you can see who is doing what and where they
  are in the code.
