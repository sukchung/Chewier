Those of us who worked on the inventory microservice backend began reviewing React resources (lectures, documentation, etc) while Adrien and Alex finished resolving auth issues on the accounts backend.

We then delegated out front end microservices, and discussed some of the basics of our plans for the UI/UX layout.
